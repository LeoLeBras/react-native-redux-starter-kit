## Make the magic happen
Just clone the repo and start :
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/LeoLeBras/react-native-redux-starter-kit.git myAwesomeApp
$ cd myAwesomeApp
$ git checkout next     # Switching to the this current branch until it will be ready for merging
$ yarn                  # Install Node.js components listed in your package.json with Yarn 😺
```

## Scripts

99% of the time you'll just have to run `yarn start` (or `npm start` if you like the old school way 😋) to launch the server. However, here are all the scripts that could be useful during your development:

|`yarn <script>`|Description|
|------------------|-----------|
|`start`|Serve your app at `localhost:8081` or on the IP address you'll set up. Then just start your emulator or switch to your device. |
|`clean`|Clear your cache and removes all the temporary files. |
|`build-ios`|Build your app for a production release on the AppStore. |
|`build-android`|Build your app for a production release on the Google Play Store.|
|`reactotron`|Launch [Reactotron](https://github.com/skellock/reactotron) (only in `_DEV_` mode). ⚠️ Remove/disable it when you'll want to generate your .apk/.ipa!|

## Application structure

This application structure should just serve as a guide. Feel free to modify it and even send us some PRs if you find a way to improve it.
To explain the how and the why of this, we'll start by stating that this structure aims to be fractal: files are grouped according to their functionalities rather than their type/name.
This led us to a simple structure with `scenes`, wrapping several `containers` connected to your store, which include little naive/UI-only `components` themselves:

```
...
src
├── bundles             
│   └── xxx             
│       ├── components  
│       ├── containers  
│       └── scenes      
├── config              
│   └── index.js        
├── core                
│   ├── index.js        
│   └── scenes.js       
├── shared              
│   ├── assets          
│   ├── components      
│   └── theme           
├── store               
│   ├── middlewares     
│   ├── modules         
│   │   └── xxx         
│   │       ├── index.js
│   │       └── types.js
│   ├── create.js       
│   ├── index.js        
│   └── reducers.js   
└── index.js            
```

## Development

#### Navigation
We're actually using [`react-native-router-flux`](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux) latest implementation `(3.x)`, and it's doing great so far.

The router is set up in `src/core/scenes.js` so this is where you'll define the different routes of your app. For instance:

```js
/* @flow */

import React from 'react'
import { Actions, Scene } from 'react-native-router-flux'
import { LaunchScene } from '@Launch/scenes'
import { WelcomeScene } from '@Welcome/scenes'

export default Actions.create(
  <Scene key="root">
    <Scene key="launch" component={LaunchScene} title="Launch">
      <Scene key="welcome" component={WelcomeScene} title="Welcome" />
    </Scene>
    ...
  </Scene>
)

```
Thus, feel free to make any modification you'd like in this file.

It sometimes happens that you wish to use some links to manage… well: the navigation 😁! You just have to use `Actions` from `react-native-router-flux` with the `key` string you defined into your `scenes.js` file:

```js
/* @flow */

import React from 'react'
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'
import { Actions } from 'react-native-router-flux'
import Button from '@components/Button'

const MyComponent = (): React$Element<any> => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Launch</Text>
      <Button onPress={Actions.welcome}>
        Start
      </Button>
    </View>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

We may change this router for something more stable and customizable in the future, but for the time being: in `react-native-router-flux` we trust!

#### Middlewares

Sometimes you need to write some promises in your app with Redux, and guess what:  `react-native-redux-starter-kit` support them now!
Here is an example of a pretty simple promise:

```js
export function getFoo() {
 return {
   types: [FOO_FETCH_REQUESTED, FOO_FETCH_SUCCEEDED, FOO_FETCH_FAILED],
   promise: (client) => client.get('/foo'),
 }
}
```

If you need any other middleware right out the box: let us know!
#### Aliases

You may have noticed something like this among my several imports:

```js
import Button from '@components/Button'
```

instead of something more like this:

```js
const Button = require(‘../../../shared/components/Button);
```
It's a little something we can use thanks to React Native, to improve the code readability. You just have to add a `package.json` file written like this:

```json
{
  "name": "@components"
}
```

to use aliases in any folder 🤗🎉.

#### Flow

[Flow](http://flowtype.org) is a static type checker for JavaScript from Facebook. It allows you to type check a variable to make sure that its input and output values match the types you defined.

For instance:
```js
Counter = (props: Props): React$Element<any> => {
```

means that your variable `props` should match the type `Props` you defined.

`React$Element<any>` is a type defined by Flow itself to represent a React element. This should help you to drastically reduce the amount of non-wanted bugs.

We also implemented libdefs from [`flow-typed`](https://flowtype.org/docs/third-party.html) to extend your code coverage.

#### .babelrc

> Are you generally just confused and frustrating by how hard it is to use the latest and greatest Babel features on React Native? This preset is for you!

[`babel-preset-react-native-stage-0`](https://github.com/skevy/babel-preset-react-native-stage-0) allows you to use Stage-0 preset from Babel and then enjoy all the good features you like. If you need decorators for instance, just add `decorator-support` in your `.babelrc` file:

```js
{
  "presets": ["react-native-stage-0/decorator-support"]
}
```

#### react-native link

You may have heard about [`rnpm`](https://github.com/rnpm/rnpm), a package manager for React Native such as `npm`. Since August 2016, `rnpm` is part of React Native so all its features are now supported by RN.

Simply by running `react-native link <package name>`, you'll link the package in iOS and Android specific files.

One of the coolest feature is the ability to install your fonts, just by adding them in `src/shared/assets ` and running: `react-native link assets` 🤗🎉.
