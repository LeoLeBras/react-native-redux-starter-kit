## Stack
- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for building native apps using react
- [Redux](http://rackt.github.io/redux/index.html)
- [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) for ES6+ support
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) module loader and bundler

## Install

Just [clone](github-windows://openRepo/https://github.com/LeoLeBras/react-native-starter-kit.git) the repo
and start :

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/LeoLeBras/react-nativve-starter-kit.git myAwesomeApp
$ cd myAwesomeApp
$ npm i                         # Install Node.js components listed in ./package.json
```

### How to use ?

```shell
$ npm start                     # or: node node_modules/.bin/react-native-webpack-server start
```

This will start a lightweight development server (webpack dev server) with live reloading.
Then open `App.xcodeproj` in Xcode, build and run the project.
